Subject: Important Notice: Academic Status Update

Dear [Student Name] [Student id],

[Programme] [School Name]
I hope this message finds you well. We are writing to inform you about an important academic matter concerning one of our students.
Upon recent evaluation of academic performance, it has been determined that a student within our institution has fallen below the expected academic standards. As a result, the student is now placed on academic probation. While we understand that students face various challenges, it is imperative for all of us to support each other in overcoming these hurdles.
We believe in the potential of every student and are dedicated to assisting them in achieving their academic goals. To this end, the university provides additional resources, including tutoring services and counseling, to support students during their studies. We encourage the student in question to take advantage of these resources and work closely with their advisor to create a plan for improvement.
We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter. Please remember that our collective efforts play a crucial role in ensuring the success of every student within our institution.
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to the Academic Affairs Office.

Best regards,
